# Sorting Visualization Web App 🎨

Welcome to the Sorting Visualization Web App! 🚀 This project provides an interactive platform to visualize and compare different sorting algorithms in action. It's designed to help users understand how various sorting algorithms work and compare their performance.

## Features 🌟

- **Interactive Sorting Visualization**: Watch different sorting algorithms sort a dataset in real-time. 🔍
- **Algorithm Comparison Mode** [Upcoming](https://github.com/Arunesh-Tiwari/sorting-visualizer/issues/2): Compare multiple sorting algorithms side-by-side. ⚔️
- **Customizable Input Data** [Upcoming](https://github.com/Arunesh-Tiwari/sorting-visualizer/issues/3): Input your own datasets or choose from pre-defined options. 🛠️
- **Speed Control and Pause/Resume** [Upcoming](https://github.com/Arunesh-Tiwari/sorting-visualizer/issues/4): Adjust the animation speed and control the sorting process. ⏩⏸️
- **Step-by-Step Visualization** [Upcoming](https://github.com/Arunesh-Tiwari/sorting-visualizer/issues/5): Navigate through the sorting process step-by-step to better understand intermediate steps. 🧩

## Getting Started

To get started with the Sorting Visualization Web App, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Arunesh-Tiwari/sorting-visualizer.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
